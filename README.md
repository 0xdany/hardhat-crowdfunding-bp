# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with basic transaction contracts and tests, and a script that deploys these contracts to Georli testnet.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
